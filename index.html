           <img src="images/logotype-dark.svg" alt="bat logo full" class="logotype-dark">
           <p>The Basic Attention Token (BAT) is an Ethereum-based digital advertising token.</p>
           <p>The mission of the BAT team is to fix the broken state of the current digital advertising space in which users are unknowingly tracked, publishers are having trouble monetizing content, and advertisers are constant victims to fraud.</p>
           <p>BAT cuts out the middlemen from the advertising process. Users are paid for their attention watching ads, and publishers receive the majority of the ad revenue directly. Additionally, advertisers gain a better ROI and more accurate data to analyze using BAT.</p>

      <h2>What is Brave Browser ?</h2>
      <p>The Brave browser is an open-source web browser created by the BAT team. With a focus on privacy and speed, the browser blocks intrusive ads and trackers automatically. Even the leading ad blockers on traditional browsers let some advertisements and trackers monitor your behavior. Brave blocks them all.</p>
      <p>It also upgrades every site that it can to use the HTTPS protocol, adding an extra layer of security when you browse. Although the browser constantly measures your attention, this information is <b>completely anonymous</b>, and your <b>private information never leaves your device</b>.</p>

          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>No, Brave will always be free to use — you don’t need to pay to block ads and tracking. We encourage you to support your favorite publishers with Brave Rewards, or get compensated for paying attention to Brave Ads, but these features are both completely voluntary. You can use one, the other, both, or neither.</p>

          <div class="acc-content">
            <p> Brave blocks ads and trackers by default. We will soon release the ability for users to opt into receiving some ads. We will offer this option as another way — beyond Brave Payments — that users can support publishers. When they do appear, there will be fewer but higher quality ads. Rest assured, that even if you opt into receiving these ads, trackers will still be blocked and your privacy will still be protected. We will provide more detail around this feature when it is ready.</p>

            <i class="fa fa-2x fa-angle-right"></i>
          </a>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>Extensions face API and performance limits. Additionally, popular extension stores often host malicious counterfeit extensions, which have lead to millions of infected users. Building our own browser lets us put our best foot forward on matters of speed and privacy. We may do extensions if our users find themselves browsing in other browsers often.</p>

          </a>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>Ads and trackers are blocked by default. You can allow ads and trackers in the preferences panel. Later, as mentioned above, Brave will let you opt into receiving a reduced ad load that comes without trackers, maintains your privacy and helps support the publishers you like.</p>

            <i class="fa fa-2x fa-angle-right"></i>
          </a>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>We have no plans to use aggregated history data for ads. There’s too much risk of re-identification via data leakage. Anything we build that might use differential privacy for other than crash and fault reporting will require a separate opt-in by the Brave user, and entail a greater revenue share via the BAT.</p>

          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>While we will block third-party cookies where you have no first-party relationship with the cookie’s domain, we don’t block first party cookies by default. However, the Brave user will have the option to selectively block/enable cookies globally or on a site-by-site basis. Google will only have the ability to track you within their own domain and they won’t be able to use that information to target you outside of google.com.</p>

          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>As earlier answers explain, we do not even have access to identifiable user data. The anonymized aggregated ad campaign related data we do collect is used for accounting and reporting, but this data cannot be mapped back to devices or user identities of any kind.</p>
